# COVID Simulation Lab 1

## Project Overview

The COVID Simulation Lab 1 is an exploratory data analysis and simulation project designed to understand the dynamics of COVID-19 spread under various public health intervention scenarios. Through a series of simulations, this lab investigates how different strategies, such as the implementation of quarantine centers and the enforcement of social distancing norms, affect the rate of COVID-19 spread within a hypothetical population. Starting with initial infection rates of 10%, 25%, and 50%, the project provides insights into the potential outcomes of public health decisions.

## Simulation Scenarios:

This project includes nine distinct scenarios, categorized into three main groups:

### No Quarantine Centers and No Social Distancing

- **Scenario 1a:** Simulates the spread of COVID-19 with an initial infection rate of 10% without any public health interventions.
- **Scenario 1b:** Increases the initial infection rate to 25%, showcasing the rapid spread in the absence of interventions.
- **Scenario 1c:** Further increases the initial infection rate to 50%, highlighting the critical impacts on public health systems.

### Adding Quarantine Centers

- **Scenario 2a:** Introduces quarantine centers into the model with a starting infection rate of 10%, examining their effectiveness in controlling the outbreak.
- **Scenario 2b and Scenario 2c:** Evaluate the effectiveness of quarantine centers at higher initial infection rates (25% and 50%, respectively).

### Enforcing Social Distancing Norms

- **Scenario 3a:** Implements social distancing measures starting with a 10% infection rate, analyzing its impact on flattening the curve.
- **Scenario 3b and Scenario 3c:** Study the combined effect of social distancing and higher initial infection rates (25% and 50%).

## Results and Analysis

The simulations reveal varying levels of effectiveness for each intervention strategy. Key findings include:

- The absence of public health interventions leads to rapid and uncontrolled spread, overwhelming healthcare systems.
- Implementing quarantine centers significantly reduces the spread, with their effectiveness being more pronounced at lower initial infection rates.
- Social distancing has a profound impact on flattening the epidemic curve, even at higher initial infection rates, emphasizing its importance as a public health strategy.
